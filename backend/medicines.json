To get the benefit from this medicine you need to make sure you get your inhaler technique right, otherwise, it does not work as well. The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, respiratory tract infection, fungal infections in the mouth, headache, hoarseness of voice, sore throat, cough, musculoskeletal (bone, muscle, or joint) pain, and increased heart rate. If you get there, do not stop taking it but do talk to your doctor. You can help prevent some of these symptoms by rinsing your mouth and throat with water or brushing your teeth after using your inhaler. There are other, rarer side effects that can be serious. Talk to your doctor if you're worried about them. In general, you should be trying to avoid situations that make your asthma worse (your triggers) and try not to smoke. Ask your doctor whether it’s safe to take this medicine if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Before taking it, you should tell your doctor if you have any kidney or liver diseases so that your doctor can prescribe a suitable dose for you.",

Give Drotin DS Oral Suspension to your child at a fixed time either before or after food. If your child develops a stomach upset, it is best to give it with food.

Drotin DS Oral Suspension can cause some minor and temporary side effects like nausea, dry mouth, and blurred vision. Usually, these episodes subside once your child’s body adapts to the medicine. However, in case these effects persist or start bothering your child, consult your child’s doctor without any delay. Let your child’s doctor know if your child is already taking any medicines. Also, narrate your child’s complete medical history, including any prior episodes of allergy, heart problem, blood disorder, vascular disorders, birth defects, airway obstruction, lung anomaly, skin disorder, liver impairment, and kidney malfunction.

It works by softening the infected skin and stopping fungal growth, helping relieve itching, redness, and scaling. Use Whitolyn Ointment as directed for optimal effects, typically once or twice a day on dry, clean skin. Regular adherence is essential to clear the infection effectively and avoid recurrence. Do not miss doses or discontinue, even if symptoms resolve, since this can cause reinfection. While side effects are rare, some people may experience mild skin irritation, such as a burning sensation, redness, or itching at the site of application. In a few cases, allergic reactions like rashes or dermatitis (skin inflammation) can occur. If any unusual or severe reaction develops, discontinue use and consult your doctor. Do not use Whitolyn Ointment if you are allergic to benzoic acid, salicylic acid, or any of the formulation's components. Avoid applying it to broken or irritated skin, open wounds, or mucous membranes. Use with caution in children or those with sensitive skin. If excessive redness, irritation, or a rash occurs, discontinue use and consult a doctor. Always wash your hands after application and avoid contact with your eyes.",

It works by killing the fungi that cause these infections. Emluz Cream should be used in the dose and duration as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use it more often or in higher quantity than prescribed as this will not clear your condition faster and may only increase the side effects. Skin infections will usually get better after 2 to 4 weeks of use. Let your doctor know if your condition does not improve. The effect of the medicine can be increased by keeping the affected area clean and dry, and washing hands before and after use. If you have athlete’s foot, wash your socks or tights thoroughly and change your shoes daily if possible. The most common side effects of this medicine include burning sensation, irritation, itching, and redness at the site of application and skin dryness. These are not usually serious and resolve with time. Call your doctor if these persist or bother you. Seek emergency help if you notice signs of an allergic reaction such as a rash, swelling of the lips, throat, or face, swallowing or breathing problems, and nausea. Avoid direct contact with your eyes. In case of accidental contact, wash your eyes with water and seek immediate medical attention. It is not likely that other medicines you take by mouth or injection will affect the way this medicine works, but talk to your doctor before using it if you have recently used another medicine that contains a steroid or had an allergic reaction to another antifungal medicine. Ask your doctor before using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

If a child has not received the 1st dose by the age of his initial year, start vaccination as soon as possible and consult your child’s doctor for the schedule. Easyfive-TT Vaccine can cause some minor and temporary side effects such as fever, irritation, loss of appetite, injection site reaction (pain, swelling, redness), and skin rash. However, these episodes do not last very long and subside on their own. If worrisome, do seek the doctor's help. Talk to your child’s doctor before vaccination if your child has a history of liver problems, kidney problems, blood disorders, birth defects, heart problems, lung problems, severe pain or swelling of the limbs, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Also, let your doctor know if your child has or had any severe allergic reactions to any medicine.

Usually, these episodes subside once your child’s body adapts to the medicine. However, in case these effects persist or start bothering your child, consult your child’s doctor without any delay. Let your child’s doctor know if your child is already taking any medicines.

    "description": "SINARest Syrup is commonly prescribed in children to treat symptoms such as runny nose, cough, sneezing, watery eyes, sore throat, body ache, and fever. These symptoms are usually associated with common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other respiratory tract conditions. Give SINARest Syrup to your child by mouth with or without food. If your child develops a stomach upset, prefer giving it with food. Always remember that the dosing schedule provided by your child’s doctor depends on the type of symptoms your child has, so make sure to follow the prescribed dose, time, and way strictly. Give SINARest Syrup at a fixed time each day so that it gradually makes a place in your child’s daily routine, which will help you to remember. If your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking this medicine give the same dose again. However, never repeat the dose if it's already time for the next dose. Your child may start to feel better within a week of regular dosing. However, you must continue giving the medicine to your child to finish the complete prescribed course as stopping it abruptly may worsen your child’s condition. Some of the minor and temporary side effects that your child may experience while taking this medicine include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, rash, and headache. Usually, these episodes subside once your child’s body adapts to the medicine. In case these side effects persist or become bothersome for your child, consult your child’s doctor without any delay. Narrate your child’s complete medical history to your child’s doctor, including any ongoing medicine regime or history of any allergy, heart problem, blood disorder, birth defects, airway obstruction, lung anomaly, skin disorder, liver impairment, and kidney malfunction. This information is critical for dose alterations and for planning your child’s overall treatment.",

    "description": "Ga - 6 Glycolic Acid Cream is a medicine used to treat dry skin. It works by exfoliating the outer layer of dead skin cells, which can help to smooth rough patches and improve the skin’s overall texture. It also enhances the skin’s ability to retain moisture. This way it helps the skin feel softer and more radiant. For best results, apply Ga - 6 Glycolic Acid Cream after cleansing your skin and before moisturizing. Apply a thin, even layer to the affected areas. If you are new to this medicine, start by using it every other day to see how your skin reacts. Apply sunscreen during the day when using the cream, as it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Ga - 6 Glycolic Acid Cream is generally well-tolerated, however, it may cause mild redness, itching, or stinging, especially when first using the product. To minimize this, start with a lower concentration or less frequent use. If irritation persists or becomes severe, stop using the cream and consult your doctor. Do not use more than directed, as overuse can lead to increased skin irritation. Avoid applying the cream to sensitive areas like around the eyes and on broken or irritated skin. Before using the cream for the first time, perform a patch test on a small area of skin to check for any adverse reactions. If you are pregnant, nursing, or have any underlying skin conditions, consult with a doctor before starting treatment.",

If your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking this medicine give the same dose again. However, never repeat the dose if it's already time for the next dose. Your child may start to feel better within a week of regular dosing. However, you must continue giving the medicine to your child to finish the complete prescribed course as stopping it abruptly may worsen your child’s condition. Some of the minor and temporary side effects that your child may experience while taking this medicine include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, rash, and headache. Usually, these episodes subside once your child’s body adapts to the medicine. In case these side effects persist or become bothersome for your child, consult your child’s doctor without any delay. Narrate your child’s complete medical history to your child’s doctor, including any ongoing medicine regime or history of any allergy, heart problem, blood disorder, birth defects, airway obstruction, lung anomaly, skin disorder, liver impairment, and kidney malfunction. This information is critical for dose alterations and for planning your child’s overall treatment.",

For allergy, it is best to give it either in the morning or in the evening, depending upon the time of onset of symptoms. In case your child has both, prefer giving it in the evening. If your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking this medicine, give the same dose again, but skip it if it’s already time for the next dose. Your child may start to feel better after a few regular doses. However, you must still complete the prescribed dose to ensure maximum benefit. Moreover, stopping the medicine abruptly may worsen your child’s condition. This medicine may cause some minor and temporary side effects like vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, rash, and headache. Usually, these episodes subside once your child’s body adapts to the medicine. However, in case these effects persist or start bothering your child, consult your child’s doctor without any delay. Let your child’s doctor know if your child is already taking any medicines. Also, narrate your child’s complete medical history, including any prior episodes of allergy, heart problem, blood disorder, vascular disorders, birth defects, airway obstruction, lung anomaly, skin disorder, liver impairment, and kidney malfunction. This information is critical for dose alterations and in planning your child’s overall treatment.",

    "description": "Ursa-HPMC Eye Drop is an eye lubricant or artificial tears used to relieve dry eyes. This can happen because not enough tears are made to keep the eye lubricated. It helps to soothe the irritation and burning seen in dry eyes by maintaining proper lubrication of the eyes. Ursa-HPMC Eye Drop is usually taken when needed. Use the number of drops as advised by your doctor. Wait for at least 5-10 minutes before delivering any other medication in the same eye to avoid dilution. Do not use a bottle if the seal is broken before you open it. Always wash your hands and do not touch the end of the dropper. This could infect your eye. This medicine may require long-term use and can be taken safely for as long as you need it. The most common side effects of using this medicine are blurred or altered vision, redness or irritation and sometimes pain in the eye. Let your doctor know if you experience these symptoms but they are usually temporary. Do not drive, use machinery, or do any activity that requires clear vision until you are sure you can do it safely. Consult your doctor if your condition does not improve or if the side effects bother you. This medicine is not likely to affect or be affected by other medicines you use but tell your doctor if you have ever had glaucoma. Do not use it while wearing soft contact lenses and talk to your doctor if you develop an eye infection while using it.",

Pantop Injection is also used to prevent stress ulcers in seriously ill patients and is administered before anesthetic medication to help prevent aspiration-related complications. It belongs to a class of medicines known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This medicine is administered into a vein by a healthcare professional and will only be given to you if your doctor thinks that an injection is more suitable for you at the moment than a tablet. The dose will depend on your underlying condition and how you respond to the medicine. Your doctor will decide the duration of treatment but you should keep on taking it as prescribed, even if your symptoms disappear quickly. You can increase the efficiency of the treatment by eating smaller meals more often and avoiding caffeinated drinks (like tea and coffee), and spicy or fatty foods. The most common side effects observed with this medicine include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, flatulence, diarrhea, stomach pain, and thrombophlebitis (pain, redness, and swelling of the vein). These symptoms are generally mild but if they bother you or do not go away, consult your doctor. Long-term use of this medicine may lead to an increased risk of side effects. For instance, using this medicine for more than 1 year may increase your risk for bone fractures, especially with higher doses.

Before taking this medicine, you need to tell your doctor if you have severe liver problems, are taking medicines for HIV, have ever had an allergic reaction to similar medicines in the past, or suffer from bone loss (osteoporosis). Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it. Avoid drinking alcohol as it makes your stomach produce excessive acid and can worsen your symptoms.

It is used in the treatment of asthma (wheezing and shortness of breath) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (a lung disorder in which the flow of air to the lungs is blocked). Your doctor will tell you how often you need to use your inhaler. The effect of this medicine may be noticeable after a few days but will only reach its maximum after a few weeks. This medicine must be used regularly to be effective, so go on taking it even if you don't have any symptoms. That means it’s doing its job. If you stop taking it your asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) may get worse. It should not be used to relieve sudden asthma attacks. If an asthma attack occurs, use your quick-relief inhaler (reliever). To get the benefit from this medicine you need to make sure you get your inhaler technique right, otherwise, it does not work as well. The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, respiratory tract infection, fungal infections in the mouth, headache, hoarseness of voice, sore throat, cough, musculoskeletal (bone, muscle, or joint) pain, and increased heart rate. If you get there, do not stop taking it but do talk to your doctor. You can help prevent some of these symptoms by rinsing your mouth and throat with water or brushing your teeth after using your inhaler. There are other, rarer side effects that can be serious. Talk to your doctor if you're worried about them. In general, you should be trying to avoid situations that make your asthma worse (your triggers) and try not to smoke. Ask your doctor whether it’s safe to take this medicine if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Before taking it, you should tell your doctor if you have any kidney or liver diseases so that your doctor can prescribe a suitable dose for you.",
